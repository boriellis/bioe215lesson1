#CHEATSHEET FOR WHAT I LEARNED

These are instructions for how to do this next time (I'm going to see if I can get my current project reorganized like this on my other computer later this week).

[Here's](https://flukeandfeather.github.io/BIOE215fall23/lessons/01_comp_proj_org.html#ref-bryan2017) Max's website with more detail on all steps. 

Step 1)
Make sure github, R, and RStudio are all up to date. To check that git is installed on your computer and the right version run `git --version` in RStudio's Terminal pane (not the Console pane). 

Step 2) Make an RStudio Project and git repository (this is the bit that's local to my machine)
In RStudio, it's file -> New Project, then New Directory -> New Project
Name your project according to normal R naming conventions.
You should save it to a subfolder you make in Documents called GitHub (it's called github on my laptop) and make sure that "create a github repository" is checked. Then click Create Project.

Step 3) Make your github repository (this is the bit that's remote)
